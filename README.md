# StephenCurry-TributeWebpage
This is an educational and practice purpose Tribute Webpage about Stephen Curry.

It was made to practice CSS and to try to make a responsive web page, though it is not as (adaptative to all screen sizes) responsive as I would like to, it turn out great for practice.

This was an original idea and it was made without any type of help (thanks a little, ChatGPT though).
So feel free to use it as inspiration if you are practicing something like this, but: - do not copy and paste it -
As an original idea I do not agree for anyone to use it as it's own. But rather to serve you as a good inspiration and practice.

NOTE: This was the first "kinda-serious" webpage I've ever done (the other three were super basic lol).
